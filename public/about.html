    <h1>About Sponsorease</h1>
    <p>
      Sponsorease is a platform built to solve the problem of connecting event organizers
      with the right sponsors. Whether you're hosting a college fest, conference, or startup
      launch — we help you get funded by verified sponsors who share your mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our system matches your submitted event requests to relevant sponsors based on category,
      budget, and purpose. Sponsors can browse submissions, express interest, and even schedule
      meetings directly with organizers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're building a bridge between ambition and support — making sponsorships simple, fast,
      and impactful.
